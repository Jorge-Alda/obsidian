- Direct nuclear reaction $p+T \to N + a$
- Resonant production $p+T \to N^* \to N + a$ with $E_\mathrm{CM} \approx m_{N^*}$ (use NWA and calculate [$N^* \to N + a$](Multipole%20expansion%20for%20the%20nuclear%20transition.md)).
- Photon process $p+T \to \gamma + N^*$, followed by [$N^* \to N + a$](Multipole%20expansion%20for%20the%20nuclear%20transition.md)
